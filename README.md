# Motivation
Foreign currency trading is mainly done by banks and other official institutions by exchanging the currency of one country for that of another. For this service, the customer is charged exchange fees. The site is intended for the general public who wants to use its services for buying and/or selling foreign currency. The site connects people who want to exchange foreign currency according to the representative rate without buying/selling fees.

# IExchange
IExchange is a website platform to connect people for currency exchange. Using the site, you can post and search for ads containing information about the desired exchange. When a match is found between two people, the two will schedule a meeting and exchange money according to the representative rate of the currency. This will save the exchange fee for both parties.

# Run the website
run the command : python manage.py runserver
